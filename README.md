# LANVis
Large Atomic Numeriment Visualization

LANVis lets you visualize very large particle data sets (produced from molecular dynamics or similar simulations). A server is running (either locally or remote) storing all data in memory. The client will send its camera position and other settings to the server which in return creates a data file with the nearest particles (sorted or not for faster rendering).
